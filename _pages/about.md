### About me

I'm an ML researcher interested in the safety, reliability and fairness of AI systems for healthcare. I'm currently as postdoctoral fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch), working with Profs. Julia Vogt and Michael Moor. Previously, I did my PhD at Imperial with Prof. Ben Glocker. <br/>

##### Background 
I started my studies with a B.Sc. in Mathematics as well as a postgraduate diploma in Statistics from the University of Strasbourg (France). Later, I graduated from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with a M.Sc. in Data Science, focusing on medical applications of machine learning. I then joined [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) (UK), where I was an Applied Researcher in their [medical imaging team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/medical-image-analysis/), focusing on developing ML models for personalized treatment as well as on open-source efforts in ML for healthcare. In October 2021, I then started my PhD at at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), advised by [Prof. Ben Glocker](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/bglocker/), graduating July 2025. During my PhD,  I was a 2024 recipient of the Google PhD fellowship in Health & Bioscience and of the Imperial College President's scholarship. And I also joined the [Kheiron Medical Technologies](https://www.kheironmed.com/) ML research team for an internship from April to October 2022.
